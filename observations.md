# Observations

## Work Round 1

- Peer-believed workflow state during latest review: No review file exists yet in `.peer-sync/reviews`, so there is no latest review state to quote. Current peer status is `working|...|round 1 work phase`.
- My believed workflow state: `mode=duo`, `phase=work`, `round=1`, `feature=duo-single-feat`, `session=active`.
- Clarity of workflow info/instructions: Mostly clear. Slight ambiguity in round 1 because instructions ask for the "latest review" state before any review has happened; I interpreted this using `.peer-sync/reviews` and peer status metadata.

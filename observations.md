# Observations (codex)

## Work Round 1

### Workflow state the peer believed to be in during latest review
No review has happened yet in this round sequence (`.peer-sync/reviews` is empty), so there is no prior review-state record.
From peer-visible status/context, peer indicates: `work` phase, `round 1`, `duo` mode, feature `duo-single-feat`.

### Workflow state I believe we are in
- Phase: `work`
- Round: `1`
- Mode: `duo`
- Feature: `duo-single-feat`
- Session: `active`
- Claude status: `working|...|round 1 work phase`
- Codex status: `working|...|round 1 work phase`

### Clarity of workflow information and instructions
Instructions are clear for this round: document observed environment state in `observations.md`, avoid code changes beyond documentation, and signal completion when done.
One minor ambiguity is wording about "latest review" in round 1, since no review artifact exists yet.

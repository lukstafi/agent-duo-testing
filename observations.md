# Observations

## Work Round 1
- Peer believed workflow state during latest review: no review artifact found in `.peer-sync/reviews`; current peer-reported state is `working|...|round 1 work phase`.
- My believed workflow state: duo mode, work phase, round 1 (`.peer-sync/mode=duo`, `.peer-sync/phase=work`, `.peer-sync/round=1`).
- Clarity of workflow info/instructions: clear overall; one minor ambiguity is asking for "latest review" in round 1 before any review exists.

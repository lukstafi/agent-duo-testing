# Observations

## Work Round 1
- Peer believed workflow state during latest review: No latest review artifact exists in `.peer-sync/reviews/`; inferred from `.peer-sync/claude.status` (`working|...|round 1 work phase`) that peer believes the workflow is Work Round 1.
- My believed workflow state: Duo mode, Work phase, Round 1, session `active`, feature `duo-single-feat`.
- Clarity of workflow information/instructions: Clear overall. Minor confusion: the `duo-work` skill header says "Round 2+" while this task is explicitly "Work (Round 1)".
- Additional context from `.peer-sync`: `docs-update-mode=true`, `auto-finish=true`, `auto-finish-timeout=60`, `early-pr=false`, and both agents report `round 1 work phase`.

# Observations

## Work Round 1
- Peer-believed workflow state during latest review: No review file exists yet in `.peer-sync/reviews`, so there is no recorded "latest review" state in Round 1. Closest available peer signal is `.peer-sync/claude.status`, which says `working|1771107128|round 1 work phase`.
- My believed workflow state: Work phase, round 1, duo mode, feature `duo-single-feat` (from `.peer-sync/phase`, `.peer-sync/round`, `.peer-sync/mode`, and `.peer-sync/feature`).
- Clarity/confusion: Mostly clear. Minor ambiguity in Round 1 because instructions ask for the peer state from the "latest review" before any review artifacts exist.

# Task: Observe and Document Your Environment (Solo Mode - Single Task)

## Objective

Document what you observe about your working environment. This is a meta-task to test agent-solo coordination between coder and reviewer roles.

### For Coder:

**Create a file `observations-coder.md`** in the repo root, and in each round, append: the state of the workflow the reviewer believed to be in during latest review, the state of the workflow you believe to be in, whether the workflow information and instructions are clear or confusing.

### For Reviewer:

In your review, following the workflow instructions, write what you believe is the current state of the workflow. In round 3, approve reviewed changes to complete this debugging session.

## Important

- Do NOT overthink this task
- Do NOT write any code
- Just document what you see and follow the phase instructions

# Review Notes

Checked:
- `observations-coder.md` exists.
- It includes role, timestamp, working directory, branch, `.peer-sync/` file list, and status file contents.
- The `.peer-sync/` file list matches the current directory contents.
- Status file contents appear to be a snapshot from the time of observation (current values differ now, as expected).

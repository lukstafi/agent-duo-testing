# Task: Observe and Document Your Environment (Duo Mode - Single Task)

## Objective

Document what you observe about your working environment. This is a meta-task to test agent-duo coordination.

## Instructions

**Create a file `observations.md`** in the repo root, and in work rounds 1, 2, 3, append: the state of the workflow the peer believed to be in during latest review, the state of the workflow you believe to be in, whether the workflow information and instructions are clear or confusing. Explore the .peer-sync/ directory for additional context and information.

In work round 4, and work rounds 5, 6, ... if they happen, do not make any file changes.

### For the reviewing phase:

In your review, following the workflow instructions, write what you believe is the current state of the workflow.

### For picking a PR and combining the PRs

Negotiate which PR to pick, e.g. Claude's. In the cherry-picking phase, the other peer appends their complete observations file to the picked PR's observations file.

## Important

- Do NOT overthink this task
- Do NOT write any code
- Just document what you see and follow the phase instructions

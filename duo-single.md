# Task: Observe and Document Your Environment (Duo Mode - Single Task)

## Objective

Document what you observe about your working environment. This is a meta-task to test agent-duo coordination.

## Instructions

1. **Observe your environment:**
   - What is your worktree path?
   - What branch are you on?
   - What files exist in `.peer-sync/`?
   - What is your agent name (from `agent-duo phase`)?

2. **Create a file `observations-{your-agent-name}.md`** in the repo root containing:
   - Your agent name
   - Current timestamp
   - Working directory path
   - Branch name
   - List of files in `.peer-sync/`
   - Any status files you can read

3. **Commit your observations** with message: `docs: add observations from {agent-name}`

4. **Signal completion** and proceed through the workflow phases as instructed.

## Important

- Do NOT overthink this task
- Do NOT write any code
- Just document what you see and follow the phase instructions
- Create a PR when prompted with your observations

# Observations - Coder

## Round 1 (Work Phase)

- **Reviewer's believed state**: No reviewer feedback yet (Round 1, no prior review exists).
- **My believed workflow state**: Work phase, Round 1, Solo mode. I am the coder implementing the task. The reviewer has not yet reviewed anything.
- **Clarity of workflow instructions**: The instructions are clear. The task description tells me to create this file and document observations. The phase instructions (work phase) tell me to implement, then signal done. The overall flow is straightforward.
